    "- Robust and accurate\n",
    "- Resistant to overfitting.\n",
    "- With an appropriate kernel choice, can work well when the data is not-linearly separable in the base feature space. The trick is that the data is projected to higher dimension feature space to formulate a linear problem in that space.\n",

    "### Implementation: Model Performance Metrics\n",
    "With the predefined functions above, you will now import the three supervised learning models of your choice and run the `train_predict` function for each one. Remember that you will need to train and predict on each classifier for three different training set sizes: 100, 200, and 300. Hence, you should expect to have 9 different outputs below — 3 for each model using the varying training set sizes. In the following code cell, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    "- Import the three supervised learning models you've discussed in the previous section.\n",
    "- Initialize the three models and store them in `clf_A`, `clf_B`, and `clf_C`.\n",
    " - Use a `random_state` for each model you use, if provided.\n",
    " - **Note:** Use the default settings for each model — you will tune one specific model in a later section.\n",
    "- Create the different training set sizes to be used to train each model.\n",
    " - *Do not reshuffle and resplit the data! The new training points should be drawn from `X_train` and `y_train`.*\n",
    "- Fit each model with each training set size and make predictions on the test set (9 in total).  \n",
    "**Note:** Three tables are provided after the following code cell which can be used to store your results."

    "Comparing the three models, with the default settings, support vector machine classifier delivers the best F1 score, hence the best accuracy of all, however KNN and decision tree classifiers, respectively have shorter calculation times. \n",
    "Decision tree classifier (DTC) is obviously overfitting the training set with the default setting. To have a fair comparison between the tree models, it would be a good idea to limit the max_depth to avoid overfitting. After setting max_depth=2, DTC slightly outperforms SVC in any aspect. However, SVC supports arbitrary boundary directions, and we are not dealing with a huge data set here, I tend to chose SVC over DTC. "
